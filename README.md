# dspace-data-collection

All of these scripts require a secrets.py file in the same directory that must contain the following text:
```
        baseURL='https://dspace.myuni.edu'
        email='dspace_user@.myuni.edu'
        password='my_dspace_password'    
        filePath = '/Users/dspace_user/dspace-data-collection/data/' # directory into which to store output files
        handlePrefix = 'http://dspace.myuni.edu/handle/' # handlePrefix may vary from your dspace url (or may not)
```
This secrets.py file will be ignored according to the repository's .gitignore file so that DSpace login details will not be inadvertently exposed through Github

*Note that all of these scripts skip collection '24' for local reasons. To change this, edit the following portion of the script (typically between line 27-39)

Skips collection 24 

        for j in range (0, len (collections)):
          collectionID = collections[j]['id']
          if collectionID != 24:
            offset = 0
            
No collections skipped:

        for j in range (0, len (collections)):
          collectionID = collections[j]['id']
          if collectionID != 0:
            offset = 0

Based on user input, this script extracts all of the item metadata from the specified collection to a JSON file.

#### [getCompleteAndUniqueValuesForAllKeys.py](getCompleteAndUniqueValuesForAllKeys.py)
This script creates a 'completeValueLists' folder and for all keys used in the repository, extracts all values for a particular key to a CSV with item IDs.  It also creates a 'uniqueValueLists' folder, that writes a CSV file for each key with all unique values and a count of how many times the value appears.

#### [getGlobalLanguageValues.py](getGlobalLanguageValues.py)
This script extracts all unique language values used by metadata entries in the repository to a CSV file.

#### [getLanguageValuesForKeys.py](getLanguageValuesForKeys.py)

#### [getRecordsWithKeyAndValue.py](getRecordsWithKeyAndValue.py)
Based on user input, this script extracts the ID and URI for all items in the repository with the specified key-value pair to a CSV file.

#### [metadataOverview.py](metadataOverview.py)
This script produces several CSV files containing different information about the structure and metadata of the repository:

|File Name |Description|
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|collectionMetadataKeys.csv | A list of all keys used in each collection with collection name, ID, and handle.|
|dspaceIDs.csv | A list of every item ID along with the IDs of the collection and community that contains that item.|
|dspaceTypes.csv | A list of all unique values for the key 'dc.type.'|
|keyCount.csv | A list of all unique keys used in the repository, as well as a count of how many times it appear.|
